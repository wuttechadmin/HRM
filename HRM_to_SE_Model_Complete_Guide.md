## üß© Current HRM Understanding

### **What Makes HRM Different from Traditional Neural Networks?**

#### **1. Problem-Solving vs Pattern Recognition**
- **Traditional Neural Networks**: Learn to recognize patterns (image classification, sentiment analysis)
- **HRM**: Learns to **reason through multi-step problems** with sequential logic

#### **2. Sequential Reasoning vs One-Shot Prediction**
- **Traditional**: Input ‚Üí Process ‚Üí Single Output
- **HRM**: Input ‚Üí **Think Step 1** ‚Üí **Think Step 2** ‚Üí **Think Step 3** ‚Üí ... ‚Üí Final Solution

#### **3. Working Memory**
- **Traditional**: No memory of intermediate steps
- **HRM**: Maintains a "working memory" of partial solutions and reasoning states

#### **4. Constraint Satisfaction**
- **HRM Specialty**: Learning complex rule systems (Sudoku constraints)
- **Advantage**: Transferable to other constraint-based domains (software architecture, system design)

### **Current HRM Architecture**
```python
class HierarchicalReasoningModel:
    def __init__(self):
        self.hidden_size = 256        # Brain capacity per reasoning step
        self.num_layers = 4           # Reasoning depth (how many steps)
        self.num_attention_heads = 8  # Parallel reasoning streams
        self.vocab_size = 10          # Output space (digits 0-9)
        self.max_sequence_length = 81 # 9x9 Sudoku grid
```

## üöÄ HRM Training Process

### **Phase 1: Data Loading** üìö
```
üîç Loading Sudoku puzzles from dataset...
üìä Training Set: ~45,000 puzzles
üìä Validation Set: ~7,500 puzzles
```

### **Phase 2: Model Architecture Setup** üèóÔ∏è
```
üß† Hidden Size: 256 dimensions (adjustable)
üîó Transformer Layers: 4 layers (reasoning depth)
üëÅÔ∏è Attention Heads: 8 heads (parallel reasoning streams)
```

### **Phase 3: The Training Loop** üîÑ

       | 6 9 . | . . . | . . . |
```

**Step 2: Hierarchical Reasoning**
- **Layer 1**: "What numbers can go in each empty cell?"
- **Layer 2**: "Which placements would be consistent?"
- **Layer 3**: "What's the logical next step?"
- **Layer 4**: "How does this affect other cells?"

**Step 3: Prediction & Learning**
```
Model's attempt: | 5 . 1 | . . 7 | . 2 . |
Correct answer:  | 5 4 1 | 3 8 7 | 9 2 6 |
                    ‚Üë
                  Error here - learn from this!
```

```
*Model develops multi-step reasoning*

#### **Fine-tuning (Epochs 15-20)** ‚ú®
```

```
*Model polishes reasoning approach*

### **Success Benchmarks**
