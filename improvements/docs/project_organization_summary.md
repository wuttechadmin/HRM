# Project Organization Summary

This document summarizes the changes made to organize the HRM project structure while maintaining compatibility with the active training process.

## Current Organization Structure

The project has been organized in a way that preserves the original repository structure while providing a more organized structure for future development:

1. **Original Repository Structure**: All original files remain in their original locations to avoid disrupting the active training process.

2. **Organized Structure**: A parallel set of directories has been created with clear separation of concerns:

   - `/docs`: Documentation files moved from root
   - `/improvements`: Contains improved versions of files and additional documentation
   - `/notebooks`: Jupyter notebooks directory
   - `/models`: Model architecture definitions
   - `/utils`: Utility functions
   - `/tests`: Test files moved from root
   - `/results`: Output and evaluation results
   - `/dataset`: Dataset generation scripts
   - `/data`: Dataset files

## Important Notes

1. **DO NOT MODIFY** any notebooks while training is in progress.
2. The root notebook `HRM_Sudoku_MPS.ipynb` is actively used for training and should not be moved.
3. Files have been copied to their respective directories but original files remain in place to prevent disrupting ongoing training.

## Future Recommendations

Once the current training process is complete, consider:

1. Fully migrating to the organized structure
2. Implementing improved early stopping as detailed in `/improvements/docs/early_stopping_improvements.md`
3. Adding proper documentation for all modules
4. Implementing proper logging for training and evaluation
5. Setting up a consistent testing framework

## Early Stopping Improvements

The early stopping implementation has been documented in `/improvements/docs/early_stopping_improvements.md` with the following key enhancements:

1. Minimum improvement threshold to prevent resetting patience for insignificant improvements
2. Combined metric tracking for both validation accuracy and loss
3. Improved decision logic for determining when to save the best model
4. Visualization of training progress and early stopping indicators

These improvements should be implemented only after the current training process is complete.

## Moving Forward

For any new development:
- Add new files to the appropriate directories in the organized structure
- Maintain backward compatibility with the current training process
- Document any changes or improvements in the `/improvements/docs` directory
- Test new features thoroughly before integration

This approach balances immediate organizational needs with the requirement to avoid disrupting the active training process.
